<h3> Hi, I'm Rishabh <img src="/assets/images/hi.gif" width="30px"></h3>

Passionate about Distributed Systems and Data Services, currently, I am involved in developing <a href="https://d2iq.com">D2iQ</a>'s(previously, Mesosphere) Kubernetes Platform (DKP) products. I am an Open Source enthusiast and like to contribute back to community whenever possible. I have contributions in organisations like <a href="https://github.com/mesosphere">D2iQ</a>, <a href="https://github.com/replicatedhq">Replicated</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kudobuilder">Kudobuilder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fluxcd">Flux</a>, <a href="https://github.com/github">Github</a> and popular projects like <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">OhMyZsh</a>.


I work at <a href="https://d2iq.com">D2iQ</a>(previously, Mesosphere) as a Software Engineer(Contractor) from TCS. I work with Go, Docker, Kubernetes, DC/OS, Confluent, Apache Kafka and Zookeeper, Elasticsearch etc. and responsible to add features and release the latest versions and make them available on our platforms. I am also a voting member at <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>.
