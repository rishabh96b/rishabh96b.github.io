I'm a software engineer who likes to work in the intersection of **Cloud technologies**, **Data Services frameworks** and **Automation**.

I've spent the last few years working on messaging systems like Kafka, containers and container orchestration frameworks like **Apache Mesos**(mainly DC/OS) and **Kubernetes**. In the spare time, I like contributing to the Open Source Projects, Hiking in the mountains and capturing the beautiful nature through my mobile lenses.

My goal is to tackle complex and interesting problems in challenging, creative and intellectually stimulating environments with a strong engineering culture.
